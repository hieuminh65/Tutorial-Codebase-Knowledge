# Tutorial: go-grpc-graphql-microservices

This project demonstrates a backend system built using a **Microservice Architecture**.
It simulates core features of an online store, separating functionalities into independent services: *Account*, *Catalog*, and *Order*.
These services communicate *internally* using **gRPC**, a high-performance communication protocol defined by Protocol Buffers.
An **API Gateway** exposes a single *GraphQL* endpoint to the outside world, simplifying client interactions by consolidating data from the various microservices.
Each service manages its own data, with *Account* and *Order* using PostgreSQL databases defined by their specific schemas.
